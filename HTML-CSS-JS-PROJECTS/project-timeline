1.) styling the comment score interface
    in such a way that no matter the range of the score
    be it 1000-10000, 100-1000, 10-100, e.t.c
    the style of the interface is not greatly affected.

    my implementation was;
    as the score range changes, 
    the font size of score value dynamically chages also
