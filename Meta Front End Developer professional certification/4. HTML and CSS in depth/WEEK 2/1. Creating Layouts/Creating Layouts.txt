	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( intro )
		- layout is one of the most important components 
		- of designing a good web page 
		- because layouts help divide a page 
		- into different sections, thus making the page more presentable.

		- css capability has grown 
		- to allow several layout option
		- such as boxes, flex boxes, grids


	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( css mental model )
		- CSS can be used to enhance a web page by modifying 
		- FONTS, COLORS, LAYOUT, SIZE and
		- other style formatting options 
		- that make the web page more presentable. 

		- the browser window that is visible 
		- to the user on the screen is called the VIEWPORT. 

		- the idea behind any CSS web layout 
		- is to create an optimally designed web page 
		- that has a good viewport at any given point. 




























Css Web Layout:

	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( display property - box )
		- the display property specifies 
		- the type of box that you want to use 
		- for a given html element. 

		- it determines if a rendered boxes 
		- is an inline or block box models, 


	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( display property - flex vs grid )
		- block type are good but evolving requirements 
		- led to the development of CSS web layouts 
		- such as flex box and grid

		- they added more FLEXIBILITY and DIMENSIONALITY 
		- with better options for fine tuning 
		- specific sections of a web page. 

		- the main difference between the two is that 
		- flex box is one dimensional while 
		- grid is two dimensional.


























Css Web Layout:

	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( flexbox overview )
		- flex box is short for flexible box model
		- enabled with a display property with value "flex".

		- flex box adds responsiveness to CSS 
		- with FLOAT ELEMENTS and POSITIONING 

		- flex box is one dimensional 
		- this refers to the fact that 
		- a given flex box container 
		- will arrange items in either a column 
		- or a row along its axis. 

		- the flex box container applied over an element 
		- can flex to shrink or expand. 
		- thus resulting in a flexible responsive design. 


	CSS WEB LAYOUT ( grid overview )
		- css grid creates a two dimensional grid 
		- along both the row and column axes. 
		- enable with the display property set to "grid"

		- while the grid increases dimensionality 
		- and helps to create an advanced layout with relative ease. 
		- it can also lead to increased complications later. 
		- if the element rules are not systematically defined, 

		- there is no strict rule on choosing which layout to use, 
		- but in general flex boxes are more suitable 
		- when you want to create flexible elements in smaller spaces 
		- while grids are more suitable to large scale layouts. 



























Flexbox:

	FLEXBOX PROPERTIES ( intro )
		- a flex box has two axis "main-axis" & "cross-axis"
		- by default "main-axis" is the x-axis (row)
		- and "cross-axis" is the y-axis (column)

		- the properties you choose will help better 
		- control alignment, spacing, direction and 
		- eventually styling of the container and items present inside it. 


	FLEXBOX PROPERTIES ( allignment property )
		- there are four main properties used to align 
		- a flex container and items present inside it:  

		- justify-content. For item alignment on main axis.
		- align-items. For item alignment on cross axis.
		- align-self. For unique flex items on cross axis.
		- align-content. Used for packing flex lines and control over space.
