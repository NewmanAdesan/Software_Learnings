Effect:

	EFFECT ( intro )
		- applying effects to web pages is an essential skill
		- for a front end web developer.

		- effect is a change that is a 
		- result or consequence of an action or other cause

		- animations are a type of effect  
		- animations are graphics in motion, transitioning over time. 

		- webpage effect started with GIFs (graphics interchange format)
		- then FLASH came along which needed a special browsers plug-in
		- then came along libraries like JQuerry & Pop Motion among other.
		- the downside to this libraries is that 
		- they are hard to learn and can increase 
		- the development time of websites considerably

		- now with CSS we can produce suprisingly good effects
		- it is easy to learn and simplifies web development
		- which manipulated formats such as scalable vector graphics(SVG)


	EFFECT ( common effects - hover effect)
		- the hover effect is possibly one of the 
		- most frequently used effects on web pages. 

		- highlighting it in some way when the mouse hovers over it. 
		- for example, the lightening or darkening of an element 
		- or even other effects that highlight the placement of the cursor.

 
	EFFECT ( common effects - cursor effect )
		- another popular effect is changing the appearance of the cursor 
		- instead of the conventional arrows. 

		- you can add animated effects that change 
		- the color or gradient and so on. 


	EFFECT ( common effects - parallax effect )
		- it gives users the perception of depth and dimension 
		- with foreground elements moving faster than the background elements.


	EFFECT ( common effects - back to the top effect )
		- it is a simple element like a button 
		- that enables quickly scrolling all the way 
		- to the top of the page. from the current button placement


	EFFECT ( common effects - slide shows/galleries )
		- you are surely familiar with sliding galleries and slide shows. 
		- they are commonly used to display collections of images or text boxes 
		- and then you get video backgrounds which are commonly added 
		- to the top of the screen to illustrate movement, 


	EFFECT ( common effects - full screen snapping effect )
		- full screen snapping is a quick transition 
		- from one page to another that occurs 
		- automatically while users are scrolling.


	EFFECT ( common effects - focus )
		- developers commonly used element and color transitions 
		- to emphasize focus on objects. As users scroll through web pages.  


	EFFECT ( pros )
		- the primary driving factor of web pages these days 
		- is to attract the attention of users. 
		- web pages that use animation and effects 
		- optimally keep the attention of users without overwhelming them. 

		- effects help highlight the special features on a given page. 
		- CSS styling and effects improve the creativity and aesthetics of websites


	EFFECT ( cons )
		- too much of it can also lead to distraction 
		- and drive users away from the page. 

		- besides more animations, increase the size of your CSS files 
		- which can cause your web page to load slowly in areas with low bandwidth. 

		- nonetheless, effects improve online experiences in general 
		- and are especially used to create intuitive navigation
































Text Effect:

	TEXT EFFECT ( text-overflow )
		- With the help of CSS, 
		- you can make the most of texts by adding interesting effects

		- the "text-overflow" property 
		- determines how overflowing content
		- is displayed on your website
		- when the property is set to "ellipsis",
		- three dots replaces the clipped text

			| this is a long text, ...| 

			.text {
				width: 300px;
				white-space: nowrap;
				overflow: hidden;
				text-overflow: ellipsis; /* clip */;
			}

			.text:hover {
				overflow: visible;
			}

		- the white-space CSS property controls 
		- how white-space inside an element is handled
		- plus we added a nice hover effect that makes the overflow visible

		- the value can be set to "clip"
		- which simply clips the text without add the three dot "..."



	TEXT EFFECT ( vertical text )
		<h1>Vertical Text</h2>
		<p>The chefs draw inispiratin from italian, Greek and Turkish ...</p
		<p class="vert">12-15 items</p>
		<p>that they rotate sesonally</p>

		<style> 
			.vert{
				writing-mode: vertical-rl  
			}
		</style>


	TEXT EFFECT ( text-shadows )
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="glow"> Little  Lemon </h1>
			<h3 class="glow"> Open for dining !</h3>
		</div>

		<style>
			body{
				text-align: center;
				font-size: 25px;
				font-family: "Papyrus";
				background-color: #070101;
			}

			.glow {
				color: rgb(237, 237, 151)
				text-shadow:	/* x y blur-radius color */
					0 0 7px #fff,
					0 0 10px #fff,
					0 0 31px #fff,
					0 0 55px rgb(255, 226, 4),
					0 0 91px rgb(255, 226, 4),
					0 0 100px rgb(255, 226, 4)
					0 0 122px rgb(255, 226, 4),
					0 0 140px rgb(255, 226, 4);
		</style>
































Transform & Transition:


	TRANSFORM & TRANSITION ( intro )
		- two CSS properties used to create basic animation
		- are "transform" & "transition"

		- transform property modifies the spatial position of an element. 
		- for instance, it can change its scale and angle, 

		- but these changes are not very effective or user friendly 
		- because they are instantaneous to really create the illusion of motion.
		- this is where the transition property comes in.

		- transition property controls the speed of the transformation
