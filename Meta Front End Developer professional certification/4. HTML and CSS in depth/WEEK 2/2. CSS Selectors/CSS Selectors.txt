Selector Specificity:

	SPECIFICITY ( intro )
		- you might accidentally add more than one rule over the same element. 
		- this results in conflicts as only one rule can be applied to a specific property.
		- this means there has to be a priority tree.
		- an hierarchy if you will.


	SPECIFICITY ( hierarchy category )
		- there are four categories in this hierarchy.
		- inline styles with 1000 points
		- ID with 100 points
		- class, attributes & pseudo-classes with 10 points
		- element, pseudo-element with 1 points


	SPECIFICITY ( calculation )
		- the calculation is simple
		- #hello {} will be 0100
		- div {} will be 0001 and
		- div p.foo {} will be 0012


	SPECIFICITY ( more info )
		- there are a few more guidelines and rules 
		- that become important especially in cases 
		- when the score for the different selectors is the same. 

		- Some of these are:
		- Every selector will have a score and place in the hierarchy

		- in the case of selectors with equal specificity, 
		- the latest or last written rule is the one that will be applied

		- in general, ID selector should be applied in cases 
		- where you need to be certain about a rule 

	- universal selectors have zero specificity value





























Combination Selectors:

	COMBINATION SELECTORS
		- CSS makes it possible to combine more than one selector 
		- so that you can apply rules to elements 
		- based on their relationship with one another. 

		- you do this with combination selectors, 
		- and there are four main types. Namely, 

		- descendant selectors ( space ) 
		- child selectors ( > )
		- general sibling selectors ( ~ ) and 
		- adjacent sibling selectors ( + )


	COMBINATION SELECTORS ( general sibling selectors )
			<div id="blog">
				<h1>Latest News</h1>
				<div>	
					<h1>Weather Forecast</h1>
					<p>The weather will be sunny</p>
					<p>Tomorrow will be rainy</p>
				</div>
				<h1>Old News</h1>
			</div>

		- general sibling selectors 
		- targets all elements of same type after reference element
		- h1 ~ p { color: blue } 
		- this selects all p elements that are next siblings of an h1 element
		- The weather will be sunny, Tomorrow will be rainy,  Old News.


	COMBINATION SELECTORS ( adjacent sibling selectors )
		- adjacent sibling selectors
		- targets the first element directly following the reference element
		- div + h1 { color: blue } would only select "Old News"
		- note that if there was a p tag before "Old News"
		- "Old News" would not be selected. it has to be "Adjacent"





























Pseudo-Classes:
	
pseudo-classes are state based selectors
meaning they allow you select element based on their state
for example the hover state ":hover"

You use pseudo-class selectors to improve the interactivity of web pages by styling elements in response to user input. In this video, you will explore
