Selector Specificity:

	SPECIFICITY ( intro )
		- you might accidentally add more than one rule over the same element. 
		- this results in conflicts as only one rule can be applied to a specific property.
		- this means there has to be a priority tree.
		- an hierarchy if you will.


	SPECIFICITY ( hierarchy category )
		- there are four categories in this hierarchy.
		- inline styles with 1000 points
		- ID with 100 points
		- class, attributes & pseudo-classes with 10 points
		- element, pseudo-element with 1 points


	SPECIFICITY ( calculation )
		- the calculation is simple
		- #hello {} will be 0100
		- div {} will be 0001 and
		- div p.foo {} will be 0012


	SPECIFICITY ( more info )
		- there are a few more guidelines and rules 
		- that become important especially in cases 
		- when the score for the different selectors is the same. 

		- Some of these are:
		- Every selector will have a score and place in the hierarchy

		- in the case of selectors with equal specificity, 
		- the latest or last written rule is the one that will be applied

		- in general, ID selector should be applied in cases 
		- where you need to be certain about a rule 

	- universal selectors have zero specificity value
























Combination Selectors:

	COMBINATION SELECTORS
		- CSS makes it possible to combine more than one selector 
		- so that you can apply rules to elements 
		- based on their relationship with one another. 

		- you do this with combination selectors, 
		- and there are four main types. Namely, 

		- descendant selectors ( space ) 
		- child selectors ( > )
		- general sibling selectors ( ~ ) and 
		- adjacent sibling selectors ( + )


	COMBINATION SELECTORS ( general sibling selectors )
			<div id="blog">
				<h1>Latest News</h1>
				<div>	
					<h1>Weather Forecast</h1>
					<p>The weather will be sunny</p>
					<p>Tomorrow will be rainy</p>
				</div>
				<h1>Old News</h1>
			</div>

		- general sibling selectors 
		- targets all elements of same type after reference element
		- h1 ~ p { color: blue } 
		- this selects all p elements that are next siblings of an h1 element
		- The weather will be sunny, Tomorrow will be rainy,  Old News.


	COMBINATION SELECTORS ( adjacent sibling selectors )
		- adjacent sibling selectors
		- targets the first element directly following the reference element
		- div + h1 { color: blue } would only select "Old News"
		- note that if there was a p tag before "Old News"
		- "Old News" would not be selected. it has to be "Adjacent"
























Attribute Selectors:
		
		- [attribute]
		- [href] - elements with the href attribute

		- [attribute=value]
		- all elements with this attribute with specified value

		- [attribute^=value]
		- a[href^="https"]
		- every a element with href attribute value begins with "https"

		- [attribute$=value]
		- a[href$=".docx"]
		- every a element with href attribute value ends with ".docx"

		- [attribute*=value]
		- a[href*="meta"]
		- every a element with href attribute value has substring "meta"

		- [attribute|=value]
		- [lang|="en"]
		- selects all elements with a lang attribute 
		- with value equal to "en" or starting with "en-"
		

		- [attribute~=value]
		- selects all elements with a title attribute containing the word "flower"
		- that means two spaces are separated by the word flower
























Star Selectors:

	the universal selector (*) 
	selects everything in the document and apply styling to them. 

	this is very useful to remove browser default styling on all element.

		div * {
		   background-color: red;
		}

		* {
			text-align: center;
			color: green;
			margin: 0;
			padding: 0;
			font-size: 30px;
			border: 0;
		}






















Pseudo-Classes:
	
	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( concept )
		pseudo-classes are state based selectors
		meaning they allow you select element based on their state
		for example the hover state ":hover"

		you use pseudo-class selectors 
		to improve the interactivity of web pages 
		by styling elements in response to user input.

		selecting an element when it is active or in-focus, 
		or when a link has already been visited

		targeting specific elements say, 
		the fifth item in a list, bold items, empty elements, and so on.

	
	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( concept )
		- we can group pseudo-classes into three states
		- actions states
		- form states
		- specific position-based states

		- this is the syntax of pseudo-class specification
				selector:pseudo-class {
					property: value
				}


	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( action states )
		- the "action states" pseudo-classes
		- these pseudo-classes have an effect 
		- while a user is actively engaging with a HTML element

		- ":hover" 
		- changes the style of an element when a cursor hovers over it

		- ":active" 
		- styles an element only while a user 
		- actively presses and holds the mouse button

		- ":focus" 
		- which focuses styling on the element that you use it 

		- ":link", "visited"
		- when a link is has-not/has been visited


	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( form states )
		- the "form states" pseudo-classes
		- they usually come in pairs and target 
		- the different states that elements can have. 
		- form state pseudo-classes include 

		- :disabled and :enabled, 
		- generally used for buttons, 

		- :checked and :indeterminate, 
		- that are used for checkboxes, 

		- :valid and :invalid 
		- used in case of fields like emails and phone numbers

		- :default
		- input:defult would be all default input elements

		- :optional, :required
		- input items with-no/with required attribute


	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( specific position-based states )
		- the "specific position-based states" pseudo-classes. 
		- they allow you to target specific items, 
		- for instance, a specific list item among the list elements. 

		- :first-of-type, :last-of-type, 
		- :nth-of-type, and :nth-last-of-type. 
		- their names makes them pretty straight forward.

		- :first-child, :last-child,
		- :nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n)
		- p:first-child all p element who are first child of their parent
		- n can be a number, a keyword, or a formula 
		- that will specify the position of an element 
		- among a group of siblings

		- :only-of-type
		- p:only-of-type all p elements with are the only p element inside its parent

		- :only-child
		- p:only-child all p elements which are only child of a parent element



	PSEUDO-CLASSES ( others )
		- :empty
		- div:empty for all div elements with no children 

		- :fullscreen
		- element in full-screen mode

		- :not(selector)
		- :not(div) all elements that not a div element
























Pseudo-Elements:

	PSEUDO-ELEMENTS ( concept )
		- pseudo-elements help you style a specific part of an element. 
		- for example, you can decide to apply styling 
		- to only the first word or line in a given element. 

		- the syntax of a pseudo-element specification
			selector::pseudo-element {

			 property: value; 

			}


	PSEUDO-ELEMENTS ( some )
		- ::first-letter
		- changes the styles of the first letter of an element

		- ::first-line
		- changes the styles of the first line of an element
		- do note that the first line of an element changes 
		- as the viewport changes

		- ::selection
		- changes the styles when you highlight specific text
		- that click and drag action you do on an element.

		- ::marker
		- how do i explain this, this is have the bullet point
		- are added to your list element
				li::marker {
						color: cornflowerblue;
						content: "<> ";
						font-size: 1.1em;

		- ::before and ::after
		- they allow you to add content before and after an element 
		- in other words, new content can be added 
		- to a page without adding HTML code for it. 
		- you can also add styling options for this content.

		- ::placeholder
		- changes styles for the placeholder
