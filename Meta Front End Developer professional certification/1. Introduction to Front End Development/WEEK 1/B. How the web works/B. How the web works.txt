	Lets talk about & link Four concepts
		- Two device connectivity
		- Network switches connectivity
		- The internet
		- Client server model


	TWO DEVICE CONNECTIVITY
		- you open your favorite app on your device 
		- and you're instantly connected to the world.

		- this is all made possible because TWO DEVICES connect 
		- and communicate via a wired or wireless connection, forming something called a network. 
		- you can connect multiple devices to this network. but this becomes very complicated very quickly, 
		- as each device needs to connect to every other device to communicate effectively.



	NETWORK SWITCHES CONNECTIVITY
		- this problem is solved by something called a NETWORK SWITCH 
		- that connects multiple devices and allows them to communicate with each other.

		- the network switch can connect to other network switches, and now two networks can connect. 
		- these network switches then connect to more network switches 
		- until you have something called an interconnected network. called THE INTERNET. 



	INTERNET
		- the internet connects the entire world. 
		- have you ever had a video call with someone on another continent? 
		- that video data travel through large undersea cables connecting the world's networks. 
		- these cables can transfer huge volumes of data per second. 



	CLIENT SERVER MODEL
		- when we use websites or video streaming services on the Internet, 
		- these are provided by computers called servers. Our devices are called clients. 
		- This is known as the client-server model	



















How the Internet works (server & webserver):
	We will discuss two concepts
		- A Server
		- A Webserver


	SERVER (concept)
		- a server is a computer that runs applications and services 
		- ranging from websites to instant messaging. 
		- it's called a server because it provides a service 
		- to another computer(its user) also known as the client. 


	SERVER (location)
		- a server is typically stored in something called a DATA CENTER
		- with hundreds or thousands of other servers, 
		- all running different services connected to the internet. 


	SERVER (component - hardware/software)
		- A server consists of hardware & software.
		- the hardware is the physical component of the server, 
		- the code that runs on the server is called the software. 



















How the Internet works (server & webserver):

	WEBSERVER (functionality)
		- Basically this is a special type of computer 
		- that allows other computers to make requests for data. 
		- it delivers contents of a websites to clients who needs it  
		
		- a web server has many functions which includes 
		- website storage and administration, 
		- data storage, 
		- security and managing email. 
		- and primarily handling web request. 


	WEBSERVER (handling web request)
		- when you open a browser on your device and type the name of the website, 
		- it's the job of the web server to send you back to that website's content. 
		- this process is known as the request response cycle. 



















How the Internet works (webpage):

	We will briefly discuss three concepts regarding webpages	
		- Web page & websites
		- Web page technology (html, css, javascript)
		- Web page rendering


	WEBPAGE & WEBSITE
		- a web page is a document that displays 
		- images, texts, videos and other content in the web browser, 
		- a website is a collection of webpages that link together. 


	WEB PAGE TECHNOLOGY
		- if you want to work with a webpage, 
		- you need to know about three technologies.
		- you need to understand how they interact and work together, 

		- they are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
		- HTML structures the content you see, 
		- CSS controls the colors and style and 
		- JavaScript is responsible for the user interaction. 



















How the Internet works (webpage):

	HTML (describes content)
		- this stands for hypertext markup language, it works by using something called markup tags. 
		- these tags DESCRIBES the content that is displayed in the browser window, 
		- this content can be things like headings, paragraphs, 
		- images and even multimedia elements such as audio and video, 
		- the way html describes the content is known as MARKUP. 


	CSS (visual enhancements to content)
		- this is short for cascading style sheets 
		- basically ADDS VISUAL ENHANCEMENT like colors and layout to the web page, 
		- it works by enhancing the HTML elements and telling them how to display. 
		- this is commonly known as STYLING.


	JAVASCRIPT (manipulate content)
		- this is a programming language built into the browser. 
		- JavaScript provides web developers with tools 
		- for interactivity, data processing, control and action. 
		- this is the powerhouse of a webpage, with the ability 
		- to manipulate the content that you see on the screen as you interact with it


	WEB PAGE RENDERING:
		- using the technologies, through code to markup, style, or manipulate the content
		- how exactly does this code get translated to display the content that you see on your screen? 

		- when a copy of that webpage is sent from the web server to your browser, 
		- each line of code is processed in sequential order from first to last. 
		- as each line is interpreted, the browser creates the building blocks, 
		- which is the visual representation you see on the screen. 
		- this creation process is known as PAGE RENDERING. 



















How the Internet works (webbrowser):
	
	Basically, we will briefly state 
		- what a web browser is 
		- how it receives and displays content.


	WEB BROWSER (concept)
		- this is a software application that you use to browse the World Wide Web. 
		- it works by sending a request to a web server and then receives a response 
		- containing the content that is to be displayed on the screen of your device. 

	WEB BROWSER	(http/html)
		- the information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, 
		- which defines how text, images and video are transmitted on the web.
		- the data received is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
		- and web browsers read this code to create what we see, hear and experience on the internet.
		- it does this through the use of a browser engine(layout engine/ rendering engine))	


	WEB BROWSER (process)
		- once the browser is open on your device, 
		- there is the address bar where you input the address of the website that you want to visit. 

		- the address is commonly known as the Uniform Resource Locator or URL for short. 
		- the URL contains 
		- the protocol or the HTTP, 
		- the domain name, usually the name of the website, 
		- and the file path, or the path to the page that is displayed. 

		- when you make a request using this URL, the browser and server communicate 
		- using a protocol known as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. 
		- once the web browser receives the content, it displays it on the screen of your device. 
		- this exchange of information is made possible by something known as the request response cycle. 



















How the Internet works (web hosting):

	We will discuss two concepts:
		- what is web hosting
		- types of web hosting 


	WEB HOSTING (need)
		- you know that websites and files are stored on web servers located in datacenters. 
		- if you wanted to create your own website? Do you really need your own datacenter? 
		- Thankfully, the answer is no. this is where web hosting comes in 


	WEB HOSTING (concept)
		- web hosting IS A SERVICE where you place your website and files 
		- on the hosting companies web server. essentially renting the space 
		- in return for stable and secure storage. 
		- you don't need to be accompanied to use a web host. Individuals can rent space too. 


	WEB HOSTING TYPES
		- we have shared hosting, virtual private hosting, dedicated hosting, and Cloud hosting. 
		- let's explore each of these hosting types in a little more detail now. 



















How the Internet works (web hosting):

	SHARED HOSTING	
		- the cheapest form of web hosting. 
		- you pay for a location on a web server containing many web hosting accounts. 
		- this means that you also share the service processing power, 
		- memory, and bandwidth with other websites. That might slow your performance. 
		- this option is best for a small website with a small number of visitors. 



	VIRTUAL PRIVATE HOSTING
		- A virtual private server is a virtual server 
		- with dedicated CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources. 
		- it will be running on a hardware server with other VPS instances 
		- but as the resources are fixed per VPS instance, 
		- your website is unlikely to be impacted by the performance of other VPS instances. 
		- a VPS instance will be more expensive than shared hosting. 



	DEDICATED HOSTING
		- this will be a hardware server that is dedicated to you only. 
		- all hardware, CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources are yours to use. 
		- generally, this option is more expensive than a VPS hosting. 



	CLOUD HOSTING
		- your website is run in something called a Cloud environment, 
		- which spans across multiple physical and virtual servers. if a physical or virtual server fails, 
		- your website will run on a different server and stay online. 

		- the main advantage of Cloud hosting is that you can use as many resources 
		- as you need without hardware limitations. However, you pay based on resource use. 
		- while this can quickly become more expensive, 
		- it allows websites and web applications to scale their costs as popularity grows. 
		- this is how many of the major web applications operate. 



















Additional Resources:

	WEB SERVER (static & dynamic pages)
		- a web server communicates with a web browser using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
		- the content of most web pages is encoded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
		- the content can be static (for example, text and images) 
		- the content could be dynamic 
		- (for example, a computed price or the list of items a customer has marked for purchase). 

		- to deliver dynamic content, most web servers support server‑side scripting languages 
		- to encode business logic into the communication. Commonly supported languages include 
		- Active Server Pages (ASP), Javascript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.


	WEB SERVER ( load balancer )
		- a web server might also cache content to speed delivery of commonly requested content. 
		- this process is also known as WEB ACCELERATION.

		- web servers can also LIMIT THE SPEED of response to different clients 
		- so as to prevent a single client from dominating resources that are 
		- better used to satisfy requests from a large number of clients.


	WEB SERVER ( application gateway )
		- a web server can even be embedded in a device such a digital camera 
		- so that the users can communicate with the device via any commonly available Web browser.
