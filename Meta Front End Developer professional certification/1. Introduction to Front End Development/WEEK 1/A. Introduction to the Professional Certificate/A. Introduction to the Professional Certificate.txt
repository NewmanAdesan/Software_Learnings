Web Developer Job roles (intro):

	When you eat at a restaurant, 
		- there are often many cooks preparing different parts of your meal. 
		- similarly for the websites and applications you use every day. 
		- many roles are involved in delivering these projects to users. 



	FINDING THE RIGHT AREA FOR YOU 
	WILL DEPEND ON A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF WEB DEVELOPERS ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES


	for example, 
		- suppose you are a visual person 
		- in that case you might want to design a stunning website 
		- that offers an excellent experience for its end users. 

		- Or if you're more analytical, you might be interested in working 
		- with the technologies that power, a high performing e commerce site. 

		- likewise, if your interest is mobile devices, 
		- your passion may lie in creating the next big social media app. 
















Web Developer Job roles ( front-end ):

	While job roles and titles may vary, web developer roles are usually split into 
		- front end, 
		- back end and 
		- full stack in this video. 


	A front end developer (basic concept)
		- is someone that works on all parts of a website 
		- or web app that users will interact with. this can be anything from 
		- the style colors, buttons, menus or user interactions 
		- as they click swipe and interact with the site. 


	A front end developer (basic skill)
		- the skills of a front end developer can vary, 
		- but they will always focus on three leading technologies. 
		- Html CSS and javascript 



	A front end developer (use case)
		- suppose you are a front end developer assigned 
		- the task of adding a newsletter, sign up option to the home page of a website. 

		- you would use HTML to build the display elements 
		- such as the input area for the user to type their email address 
		- and then the button to click to send it. 

		- you can then use CSS 
		- to position, color and style these elements on the page. 

		- And finally, you can use JAVASCRIPT 
		- to process the activity when the user clicks the button. 
		- this could be something like checking the email address is valid 
		- and then sending that email address 
		- to the website for storage under newsletter members. 

		- basically, you use javascript to process the activity when user interacts 
		  with the display created by html & css
















Web Developer Job roles ( front-end ):

	A front end developer (critical skill)
		- while html and CSS skills are essential. 
		- the most critical skill is usually javascript. 
		- basically,


		- it is the powerhouse of front end technology. 
		- this is mainly because of its versatility and the fact that it is paired 
		- with powerful libraries and frameworks such as REACT by meta. 
		- these can be used to build rich user interface driven enterprise websites 
		- and web apps that are FAST, SECURE and HIGHLY SCALABLE. 



	A front end Engineer (highly collaborative environment):
		- I think why front-end development is different 
		- is you have to work with designers, you've got to work with product managers. 
		- it's fundamentally very collaborative. what you're doing is 
		- building products for people and you're helping people solve their own problems.

		- it's good to recognize that you're a software engineering 
		- and your job is to bring a lot of their vision to life. 
		- basically knowing how to write code, how to make it work, 
		- how to make it accessible, and to shipping it to people.

		- it's got the right-brain algorithmic thinking and how to make things performant and work and then 
		- it's got the left-brain. How do you make things usable and enjoyable to use? 
















Web Developer Job roles ( front-end ):

	A front end Engineer (soft skills - empathy)
		- when it comes to soft skills, there's a lot of empathy, 
		- trying to understand other people's perspectives. 

		- engineers, we care about performance, we care about accessibility, 
		- we care about things being correct. it usually takes engineers a long time 
		- to understand designer's perspective or product manager's perspective 
		- and when this happens, empathy and an highly collaborative attitude develops
		- a good front-end engineer will actually dip their toes into back-end. 




	A front end Engineer (psychology)
		- problem-solving is consistently hard.  
		- whenever you're learning and pushing yourself, you're going to run into roadblocks. 
		- best advice is go easy on yourself. Going with the mentality 
		- that your goal is to grow and become a software engineer or a better person. 

		- adopting a growth mindset to developing is going to be critical.
		- Find time for yourself. i mean, it's not my place to talk about 
		- the psychology of being easy on yourself, 
		- but that's just as important as any of the engineering stuff you learn. 

		- For me personally, the role grows. As you build things and you solve problems, 
		- you get perspective into other problems and it's this idea of growing your scope. 



	A front end developer (end-note) 	
		- front and developer roles will be available 
		- for junior, intermediate and senior level professionals. 

		- as an aspiring developer, this is a great area to get started in entry into the job market. 
		- for a junior position is possible with some fundamental demonstrations 
		- of core concepts and skills and an eye catching sample portfolio. 

























Web Developer Job roles ( back-end ):

	A back end developer (basic concept)
		- works on the parts of a website or web app that the end users don't see. 
		- these activities occur behind the scenes, 
		- particularly on the web server in the database or in constructing the architecture. 


	A back end developer (concept)
		- is responsible for creating and maintaining functionality when users request information or 
		- when the website needs to communicate to another part of the web architecture. 
		- For processing for example, performing an account, log in 
		- or completing an online purchase using a credit card. 

		- A back end developer will facilitate 
		- the interaction of the website and the content stored in database. 


	A back end developer (skills)	
		- as a result, back end development requires different languages, skills and tools. 
		- while these can vary, they generally consist of knowledge relating to 
		- back end programming language, 
		- database management systems, 
		- API's and web servers, 


	A back end developer (the road)
		- the road to back end development is generally long 
		- as you must have a proficient understanding of the needs of front end technologies. 
		- this can include things like the inner workings of the Internet networks and servers. 
		- it's pretty common for aspiring developers to first start with the front end 
		- and then move to the back end. Once they have acquired specialist knowledge. 
















Web Developer Job roles ( back-end ):

	A full stack developer (concept)
		- is someone equally comfortable working with front end and back end technologies. 
		- they have skills and knowledge in all areas of the web development project cycle. 
		- for example they have relevant expertise in 
		- the planning architecture, 
		- design, 
		- development, 
		- deployment and 
		- maintenance of the website or web. 


	A full stck developer (end-note)
		- full stack developer positions are generally at a more senior level. 
		- it can take some time to gain the knowledge, 
		- professional experience and skills to become a full stack developer. 
		- as a result roles in this area are in high demand 
		- and are some of the best paid jobs in the IT Industry.
