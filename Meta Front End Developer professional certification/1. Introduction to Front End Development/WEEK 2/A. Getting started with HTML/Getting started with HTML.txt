What is Hyper Text Markup Language:

	
	HTML ( a framework )
		- just as a building starts with a frame of beams and rafters.
		- such that once in place, the frame guides the rest of the construction
		- an html supplies the basic structure, the framework of a webpage, 
		- it is assembled with different components such as tags and elements. 
		- html elements with their opening and closing tags 
		- in angle brackets build up an html document


	HTML ( history )
		- the first web page was created in 1999 by sir tim berners-lee. 
		- the first version of html was released in 1991 
		- along with the first web browser and web server. 

		- html stands for hypertext markup language. 
		- but what does that mean exactly? 
		- hypertext is text which contains links to other text. 
		- markup refers to tags and elements used within a document. 


	HTML ( W3C )
	- the rules and structure for elements and tags are known as the html specification. 
	- the html specification is maintained by the world wide web consortium (W3C). 
	- whenever the html specification changes a new version of html is standardized, 
	- the current version is html5. to summarize.
